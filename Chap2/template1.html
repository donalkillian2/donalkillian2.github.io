	<p>Welcome to Wild Rescues. Our mission is to rescue, rehabilitate, 
	and release wildlife back into their natural environment. We are a 
	nonprofit organization dedicated to helping injured wildlife.</p>
	<p>Our staff provides around-the-clock care for wildlife in need. We 
	also provide long-term care for wildlife that cannot be released back 
	into their natural environment.</p>
	<p>Will you partner with us? We need caring volunteers to help care 
	for our animals. You can also donate, become a member, or become a 
	sponsor. Contact us today.</p>
