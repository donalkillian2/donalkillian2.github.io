				<p>Another goal is to educate the genral public about the importance of all
				GA birds and their native habitats. We promote, not cutting down trees in the 
				spring so that parent birds can rais their chicks. Not using petisides so 
				parent birds can feed their chicks. Keeping all cats indoors so fledglings can 
				learn to fly. Human activity and free roaming cats are responsable for the
				declining bird population in Georgia.</p>
				
				<p>Georgia Bird Rehab is a fully donation funded and voluntear run facility
				liciend by GA DMR - (Department of Natral Resoures)</p>
