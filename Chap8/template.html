		<p>Welcome to Wild Rescues. Our mission is to rescue, rehabilitate, 
		and release wildlife back into their natural environment. We are a 
		nonprofit organization dedicated to helping injured wildlife.</p>
		<p>Our staff provides around-the-clock care for wildlife in need. We 
		also provide long-term care for wildlife that cannot be released back 
		into their natural environment.</p>
		<p>Will you partner with us? We need caring volunteers to help care 
		for our animals. You can also donate, become a member, or become a 
		sponsor. Contact us today.</p>
